Flight reservation System
I recent develop projectâ€”a comprehensive Flight Booking System built using C++. 
This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to effectively manage flight details, passenger bookings, and boarding pass generation.
Key Features
Flight Management: Add and display flight information.
Seat Booking and Cancellation: Book and cancel seats while ensuring availability.
Passenger Information: Store and manage passenger details for each booking.
Boarding Pass Generation: Generate and display boarding passes for passengers.
Detailed Explanation
Flight Class: This class manages flight details including flight number, origin, destination, total seats, and available seats. 
It also provides methods for booking and canceling seats.
Passenger Class: This class handles passenger information such as name, booking ID, and seat number.
Booking Class: This class handles the booking process. It allows passengers to book tickets, cancel bookings, and generate boarding passes.
Main Function: The main function provides a user interface to interact with the system, including searching for flights, 
booking tickets, canceling bookings, and generating boarding passes.
Conclusion
This project highlights the power and flexibility of C++ in building complex systems. 
It has been a great learning experience in implementing OOP principles to create a functional and user-friendly flight booking system.
